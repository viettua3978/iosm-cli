# Interactive Mode

Interactive mode is the default experience when running `iosm` without `-p` or `--mode` flags. It provides a rich multi-turn terminal session with persistent history, model switching, and keyboard-driven controls.

## Starting Interactive Mode

```bash
# Default
iosm

# With specific model
iosm --model sonnet:high

# With profile
iosm --profile plan

# Continue previous session
iosm --continue
```

## Core UX

- Multi-turn conversation with persistent session history
- Keyboard-driven controls for model, profile, and queue management
- Live tool execution rendering with expandable output
- Pending message queue for follow-up prompts
- Task plan visualization and progress tracking
- Streaming responses with interrupt/steer capability

`/singular <request>` runs a two-pass feasibility analysis (baseline scan + standard agent pass), builds concrete implementation options, and asks user to choose one.
`/blast` and `/shadow` are removed from active interactive workflow.

### `/contract` Detailed Guide

`/contract` is a layered contract editor with two sources and one merged output:

| Layer | Scope | Persistence | Storage |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `project` | Project-wide baseline | Persistent | `.iosm/contract.json` |
| `session` | Current session override | Temporary | In-memory session overlay |
| `effective` | `project + session` merged result | Derived | Computed at runtime |

Important merge rule:
- `session` overrides `project` for the same keys.
- `effective` is what the runtime actually uses.

#### Quick Difference: Effective vs Session vs Project

- `Open effective contract` is read-only and shows what runtime is enforcing right now.
- `Edit session contract` changes only this session (temporary overlay, not persisted to disk).
- `Edit project contract` changes `.iosm/contract.json` (persistent baseline for future sessions).

#### Manager Actions

| Action | What it does | When to use |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| `Open effective contract` | Shows the merged JSON currently enforced by runtime | Verify final active constraints |
| `Edit session contract` | Edits temporary overrides for current session | Experiments, one-off constraints |
| `Edit project contract` | Edits persistent project contract file | Team-wide stable defaults |
| `Copy effective -> session` | Saves merged state into session layer | Freeze current merged state for this run |
| `Copy effective -> project` | Saves merged state into project file | Promote temporary decisions to baseline |
| `Delete session contract` | Clears temporary overlay | Reset session overrides |
| `Delete project contract` | Removes `.iosm/contract.json` | Full baseline reset |

#### Field Editor Behavior

- Select a field and press `Enter`.
- Input text (single-line or multi-line list depending on field type).
- Press `Enter` to submit.
- Change is saved immediately to selected scope (`session` or `project`).
- Empty input clears that field.

There is no separate "Save" step in field editor mode.

#### Common Workflows

1. Temporary tightening for one run:
   - Open `/contract`
   - `Edit session contract`
   - Set `constraints` and `quality_gates`
   - Confirm via `Open effective contract`

2. Promote temporary policy to project baseline:
   - Open `/contract`
   - `Copy effective -> project`
   - Review `.iosm/contract.json` in VCS

3. Recover from aggressive temporary overrides:
   - Open `/contract`
   - `Delete session contract`
   - Re-open `effective` and verify fallback to `project`

### `/singular` Detailed Guide

`/singular` is a command-first feasibility mode (no pre-menu).  
Pattern: `/singular <feature request>`

Examples:
- `/singular add account dashboard`
- `/singular introduce RBAC for API`
- `/singular redesign billing reconciliation flow`

#### What Happens Internally

1. Baseline repository pass:
   - Scans project files and estimates baseline complexity/blast radius.
   - Collects likely impacted files and contract signals.

2. Standard agent feasibility pass:
   - Launches an isolated standard agent run (`plan` profile) with repository tools.
   - Agent inspects real files and returns structured feasibility JSON.
   - Produces recommendation, impact analysis, and implementation variants.

3. Merge + persistence:
   - Agent insights are merged with baseline data.
   - Analysis is saved to `.iosm/singular/<run-id>/analysis.json` (+ `meta.json`).

#### Output Shape

Each run includes:
- `recommendation`: `implement_now | implement_incrementally | defer`
- `reason`: why this recommendation is best for current stage
- `complexity` and `blast_radius`
- `stage_fit`: `needed_now | optional_now | later`
- `impact_analysis`: codebase, delivery, risks, operations
- `implementation_options` (exactly 3 variants):
  - Option 1: practical/recommended path
  - Option 2: alternative approach
  - Option 3: defer / do not implement now

Each option includes:
- summary and trade-offs (`pros`/`cons`)
- concrete file targets (`suggested_files`)
- step-by-step plan (`plan`)
- `when_to_choose` guidance

#### Decision Flow

After analysis, selector opens with variants:
- choose Option 1 / Option 2 / Option 3
- or close without decision

If Option 1 or 2 is selected, execution draft is inserted into editor (ready to run).  
If Option 3 is selected, run is explicitly marked as postponed.

#### Fallback Behavior

If no model is selected (or agent pass fails), `/singular` still returns a heuristic baseline analysis.  
Use `/model` to enable full agent feasibility pass.

#### Command Migration

- `/singular` is the feasibility command to use.
- `/blast` is deprecated/removed.
- `/shadow` is removed.

## Profiles

Profiles change the agent's behavior, available tools, and system prompt:

### Main Profiles (switchable via `Shift+Tab`)

| Profile | Tools | Use Case |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `full` | All built-ins (read, bash, edit, write, grep, find, ls, rg, fd, ast_grep, comby, jq, yq, semgrep, sed, semantic_search) | Default development work |
| `plan` | Read-only (read, grep, find, ls) | Architecture planning, code review |
| `iosm` | All + IOSM context | IOSM cycle execution with artifact sync |

### Advanced Profiles (via `--profile` or orchestration)

| Profile | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `explore` | Exploratory codebase analysis |
| `iosm_analyst` | Deep metric analysis and reporting |
| `iosm_verifier` | Verify cycle results and quality gates |
| `cycle_planner` | Plan and structure IOSM cycles |

### Example: Planning Workflow

```bash
# Start in plan mode for analysis
iosm --profile plan

# In the session:
# "Analyze the authentication module and propose a migration plan to OAuth 2.0"

# Switch to full mode for implementation (Shift+Tab)
# "Implement phase 1 of the OAuth migration"
```

---

## Streaming Input Modes

While a response is streaming, you can interact with it:

| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Steer** | `Ctrl+Enter` | Interrupt and redirect immediately |
| **Follow-up** | `Alt+Enter` | Queue message for after completion |
| **Meta** | Adaptive | Soft update at boundary checkpoints |

### Example: Steering

```
Agent: [streaming a long analysis of the codebase...]

You: (Ctrl+Enter) Focus specifically on the database layer
# Agent immediately redirects to database analysis
```

### Example: Follow-up Queue

```
Agent: [streaming response...]

You: (Alt+Enter) Also check for N+1 query issues
You: (Alt+Enter) And suggest indexing improvements
# Both messages will be processed after the current response
```

---

## Workflow Examples

### Code Review Session

```bash
iosm --profile plan --tools read,grep,find,ls

# "Review src/core/ for code quality issues, focusing on error handling"
# "Check for any security vulnerabilities in the auth module"
# "Generate a summary of findings sorted by severity"
```

### Debugging Session

```bash
iosm --model sonnet:high

# "The checkout API returns 500 errors intermittently. Help me debug."
# Agent will use bash, read, grep to investigate
# "Run the failing test with verbose output"
# "Apply the fix and verify all tests pass"
```

### IOSM Improvement Cycle

```bash
iosm --profile iosm

# "/init" (first time)
# "/cycle-plan reduce API response time"
# "Analyze the current baseline and create hypothesis cards"
# "Execute the Improve phase focusing on query optimization"
# "/cycle-status"
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

```bash
iosm

# "Launch 3 parallel agents to:
#  1. Audit auth module security
#  2. Review database query performance  
#  3. Check API contract compliance"

# Or via slash command:
/orchestrate --parallel --agents 3 \
  --profiles explore,explore,iosm_verifier \
  Audit security, performance, and contracts
```
