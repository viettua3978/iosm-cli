## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.10] - 2026-03-18

### Added

- **`/ultrathink` built-in command** — added deep multi-iteration analysis mode with robust slash parsing (`-q`/`--iterations`, `--` separator), context-aware no-query fallback, and shared behavior through `AgentSession.prompt` across interactive/print/json/rpc flows
- **Ultrathink checkpoint engine** — added structured checkpoint state (`Goal`, `Verified Facts`, `Rejected Hypotheses`, `Open Questions`, `Next Checks`) with carry-forward summaries and checkpoint compression support for long runs
- **Ultrathink read-only execution policy** — added strict temporary read-only tool filtering during ultrathink runs with guaranteed restoration of the original active tool set
- **Ultrathink evidence/runtime tests** — added dedicated parser and session-flow test suites covering iteration loops, no-query objective resolution, streaming guards, budget/stagnation paths, evidence-policy fallback, and tool-set restoration

### Changed

- **Ultrathink runtime hardening** — added budget guardrails (per-iteration input, run input/total tokens, run cost), stagnation early-stop behavior, and evidence-catalog carry-forward between passes
- **Ultrathink anti-hallucination policy** — added quantitative-claim evidence tagging rules, verify/synthesis no-new-evidence marker handling, and compliance-repair pass support
- **Ultrathink grounding behavior** — when early passes produce no tool evidence, runtime now injects an internal grounding retry that explicitly forces live read-only workspace probes before continuing
- **Interactive slash UX** — added `/ultrathink` to built-in slash registry and interactive autocomplete argument hints (`-q`, `--iterations`, common iteration counts)

### Fixed

- **Ultrathink hard-stop on evidence mismatch** — repeated evidence-policy mismatch no longer aborts the entire command; runtime now degrades gracefully and returns a best-effort final response instead of throwing
- **Internal prompt visibility leakage** — ultrathink internal retries (iteration/grounding/policy-repair prompts) are now consistently routed through hidden orchestration aliases, so users see clean progress text instead of raw directives
- **Budget accounting with internal retries** — per-iteration budget checks now account for cumulative input tokens across the main pass plus internal retry prompts

### Documentation

- Updated README header/version marker to `0.2.10`
- Added `/ultrathink` command coverage to interactive and CLI references, including read-only behavior, context fallback, and grounding-retry semantics

### Tests

- Added `test/ultrathink.test.ts` parser/validation coverage for `/ultrathink`
- Added `test/agent-session-ultrathink.test.ts` runtime coverage for q-iteration flow, early-stop, budget-cutoff, no-query fallback, evidence-policy graceful fallback, and restoration guarantees
- Expanded semantic regressions to assert `/ultrathink` built-in slash discoverability

## [0.2.9] - 2026-03-15

### Added

- **Structured verification/data tools** — added built-in `test_run`, `lint_run`, `typecheck_run`, and `db_run` with runner/adapter auto-detection, normalized statuses, bounded output capture, and tool-registry/SDK exports
- **DB runtime settings layer** — added `dbTools` settings (`defaultConnection`, named `connections`, adapter-specific fields, migrate script options) wired into session/runtime resolution for `db_run`
- **Universal terminal theme** — added built-in `universal` theme and made it the default/fallback theme for interactive mode
- **Protocol and stall auto-repair flow** — added bounded automatic recovery for raw pseudo tool markup and silent stop responses, including interactive recovery actions (retry, repeat prompt, switch model + retry, keep session)

### Changed

- **Profile tool policy expansion** — enabled `test_run`, `lint_run`, `typecheck_run`, and `db_run` across write-capable engineering profiles (`full`, `meta`, `iosm`); enabled `typecheck_run` for `iosm_verifier`
- **Interactive UX readability pass** — updated dark/light palettes, introduced universal box colors, and normalized box paddings/section spacing for user/custom/tool/plan/subagent/summary messages
- **System prompt hardening** — added explicit guidance for structured verification/data tools, instruction-priority handling, untrusted tool-output/web-content handling, completion checks before final success claims, and stricter pseudo-markup prohibition
- **Doctor diagnostics coverage** — expanded interactive `/doctor` CLI-toolchain checks to include verification and DB client commands used by new structured tools

### Fixed

- **Abort continuation wording** — when user interrupts execution, recovery selector now shows a user-action title (`You stopped the current run`) instead of model-failure wording
- **Protocol false positives** — inline explanatory mentions like `raw <tool_call>/<function=...> markup` no longer trigger protocol auto-repair; only executable-looking pseudo-blocks are repaired
- **Dark theme contrast in boxes** — fixed low-contrast text-on-dark-box cases for user/custom/tool blocks

### Documentation

- Updated README header/version marker to `0.2.9`
- Updated CLI/config/interactive/development docs with `test_run`/`lint_run`/`typecheck_run`/`db_run`, profile policy updates, `dbTools` configuration, and `/doctor` toolchain scope

### Tests

- Added dedicated tool coverage for `test_run`, `lint_run`, `typecheck_run`, and `db_run`
- Added protocol auto-repair and recovery-selector coverage in interactive/session tests (raw markup, silent stop, false-positive guard, model-switch recovery)
- Expanded regressions for profiles, SDK exports, settings manager, shadow guard, system prompt guidance, and theme defaults/colors

## [0.2.8] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **`web_search` built-in tool** — added structured web discovery with provider chaining (`Tavily -> SearXNG -> DuckDuckGo`), include/exclude domain filters, recency/topic/depth hints, runtime configuration hooks, and permission-guard integration
- **`git_write` built-in tool** — added structured git mutation actions (`add`, `restore`, `reset_index`, `commit`, `switch`, `branch_create`, `fetch`, `pull`, `push`, `stash_push`, `stash_pop`, `stash_apply`, `stash_drop`, `stash_list`) with action-specific validation, permission-guard integration, and safe argv execution (no raw shell passthrough)
- **GitHub tools settings** — added persistent `githubTools` settings block (`networkEnabled`, `token`) and interactive settings submenu for enabling git network actions and managing GitHub token
- **Expanded `git_read` actions** — added read-only actions `show`, `branch_list`, `remote_list`, and `rev_parse` while preserving backwards compatibility for existing `status`, `diff`, `log`, and `blame` contracts

### Changed

- **Shared git tool runtime** — consolidated git process execution/capture/truncation/error handling into a common internal helper used by `git_read` and `git_write`
- **Profile and mutation policy updates** — enabled `git_write` by default in write-capable profiles (`full`, `meta`, `iosm`), included `web_search` in read-oriented profiles, and updated mutation classification in task/shadow-guard checks
- **System prompt and tool-routing guidance** — added explicit guidance to prefer `git_write` over ad-hoc git bash mutations and to use `web_search` for discovery plus `fetch` for source validation
- **CLI/SDK tool surface expansion** — updated tool registry, factories, and exports to include `web_search` and `git_write` in all relevant creation paths and public SDK/index entrypoints
- **Settings/runtime wiring** — threaded web search runtime config (provider/fallback/safe-search/max-results/timeout/credentials) and GitHub network/token policy from settings into tool execution
- **Interactive menu hint UX polish** — normalized selector/menu control hints across settings, model/oauth/MCP selectors, tree/session views, and config/model-scoping panels for consistent navigation/action/search/exit guidance

### Documentation

- Updated README header/version marker to `0.2.8`
- Updated CLI/config/interactive/development/RPC docs for `web_search` behavior, `git_write` network actions, GitHub tools settings (`networkEnabled`, `token`), and expanded `git_read` action coverage
- Updated help text and tool listings to reflect the new structured git/web workflow (`web_search` + `fetch`, `git_read` + `git_write`)

### Tests

- Added dedicated `web_search` and `git_write` tool coverage, plus expanded `git_read` tests for new actions (`show`, `branch_list`, `remote_list`, `rev_parse`)
- Added/updated regression checks for profile tool membership, SDK defaults, settings manager behavior, system prompt guidance, shadow-guard/task classification, and settings/menu hint behavior

## [0.2.7] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **`fetch` built-in tool** — added structured HTTP tool with fields `url`, `method`, `headers`, `body`, `timeout`, `max_bytes`, `response_format`, `max_redirects`; includes manual redirect loop control, bounded body capture, and `auto` JSON/text formatting by `content-type`
- **`git_read` built-in tool** — added read-only structured git introspection actions (`status`, `diff`, `log`, `blame`) with action-specific validation and safe argv execution (no raw shell passthrough)
- **`fs_ops` built-in tool** — added structured filesystem mutation tool (`mkdir`, `move`, `copy`, `delete`) with explicit `recursive`/`force` safety gates and `EXDEV` move fallback (`copy + delete`)
- **SDK/public exports for new tools** — exported factories, tool singletons, and typed input/options/details surfaces for `fetch`, `git_read`, and `fs_ops`

### Changed

- **Profile tool policy expansion** — `fetch` and `git_read` are now included in read-only exploration profiles; `fs_ops` is included in write-capable engineering profiles (`full`, `meta`, `iosm`)
- **Dynamic `fetch` method policy by active profile** — read-only profiles (`explore`, `plan`, `iosm_analyst`) allow only `GET|HEAD|OPTIONS`; write-capable profiles allow full method set (`GET|POST|PUT|PATCH|DELETE|HEAD|OPTIONS`)
- **Unified tool permission/pre-hook integration** — `fetch` and `fs_ops` now pass through the same session permission and pre-tool hook pipeline used by write-capable built-ins
- **Mutation classification updates** — `fs_ops` is now classified as mutating in shadow guard and task write-capable tool checks

### Documentation

- Updated CLI help, system prompt tool guidance, and docs pages to include `fetch`, `git_read`, and `fs_ops` with usage/policy notes
- Updated profile/tool tables and architecture snippets to reflect the expanded built-in tool layer

### Tests

- Added dedicated coverage for `fetch`, `git_read`, and `fs_ops`
- Added regression assertions for profile membership, read-only/write-capable classification, shadow guard behavior, and CLI help/tool listings

## [0.2.6] - 2026-03-14

### Added

- **Shared memory scope policy** — new `IOSM_SHARED_MEMORY_SCOPE_POLICY` environment variable (`legacy` / `warn` / `enforce`) controls how missing scope arguments are handled in `shared_memory_read` / `shared_memory_write`; `meta` profile automatically activates `warn` mode so omitted scopes surface a warning in tool output and details
- **Shared memory usage analytics** — new `summarizeSharedMemoryUsage()` API aggregates write counts by scope, unique writers, unique keys, and per-task/delegate breakdown for observability in orchestrated runs
- **Nested delegation detection** — `promptMetaWithParallelismGuard` now tracks `nestedDelegationMissing`: when top-level fan-out is satisfied but no nested delegates were observed for multi-stream tasks, the parallelism correction prompt and TUI warning fire explicitly
- **Workstream semantic deduplication** — `semanticallyDeduplicateWorkstreamTitles()` uses Jaccard token similarity (threshold 0.82) to eliminate near-duplicate delegate workstream titles before dispatch
- **Duplicate delegated section detection** — `detectDuplicateDelegatedSections()` compares normalized section bodies to catch copy-pasted or near-identical delegate blocks with ≥92% coverage overlap
- **Workstream title uniquification** — `uniquifyWorkstreamTitles()` appends ordinal suffixes to disambiguate repeated titles in fan-out plans
- **Coordination details in task tool output** — `TaskToolDetails` now surfaces a `coordination` object with `sharedMemoryWrites`, `currentTaskWrites`, `currentTaskDelegateWrites`, `runScopeWrites`, `taskScopeWrites`, `duplicatesDetected`, `claimKeysMatched`, and `claimCollisions` fields for post-run auditing
- **Swarm progress shared memory integration** — TUI swarm progress reporter now reads `results/` prefix keys from shared memory to enrich per-task summary display with delegated totals

### Changed

- **META profile evidence policy** — `meta` profile system prompt and subagent task prompt now require that metrics (speedup, compliance scores, conflict counts) are backed only by observed runtime evidence; unknown values must be marked as `unknown` rather than inferred
- **META profile artifact claims** — `meta` and meta-subagent prompts now prohibit claiming report files or artifacts exist unless they were produced in the current run or verified on disk
- **`resolveScope` replaces `normalizeScope`** — shared memory tool's scope defaulting logic refactored into `resolveScope()` with policy-aware warning output and `enforce` mode that throws on missing explicit scope
- **`completedTaskToolCalls` tracking** — parallelism guard now separately tracks completed (resolved) task calls so nested delegation assessment waits for actual task completion rather than firing prematurely on partial state

### Fixed

- **False nested-delegation compliance** — guard no longer silently passes when top-level fan-out count is met but zero nested delegates exist inside multi-stream tasks; correction prompt now fires
- **Scope warning surface** — `shared_memory_write` and `shared_memory_read` tool results now include `scopePolicy` and `scopeWarning` in their `details` payload for agent-side introspection

### Documentation

- **README redesign** — complete rewrite with professional positioning, IOSM methodology section with 4-phase table and 6 metrics, architecture ASCII diagram, profile split into primary/specialist, integration modes with CI row, extensibility as runtime platform, accurate install/extension syntax from docs

## [0.2.5] - 2026-03-13

### Added

- **Orchestrate parallel fan-out defaults** — `/orchestrate --parallel` now auto-sets `--max-parallel` to the selected agent count when omitted, reducing accidental single-lane execution
- **Parallel worker profile auto-selection** — when no worker profile is provided in parallel orchestration, assignments default to `meta` in write-capable host contexts for stronger orchestration behavior
- **Delegate hint propagation for orchestrate assignments** — assignment generation now injects `delegate_parallel_hint` guidance to drive nested delegate fan-out inside child tasks
- **Swarm dispatch timeout controls** — scheduler now supports bounded dispatch timeouts (including `IOSM_SWARM_DISPATCH_TIMEOUT_MS`) to avoid silent long stalls
- **Interactive swarm progress surfaces** — improved live subagent task/delegate progress rendering and swarm-aware footer busy state in TUI

### Changed

- **Task profile defaulting** — task tool now defaults missing `profile` to current host profile (fallback `full`) instead of always forcing `full`
- **Delegation depth baseline** — max delegation depth default increased to `2` for better nested decomposition capacity
- **Shared memory read behavior** — `shared_memory_read` now returns metadata-only by default (`include_values=false`) with safe value preview details when requested
- **Swarm planning fan-out quality** — planner now prioritizes code-relevant touches and partitions work into multiple workstreams more aggressively for parallel execution
- **Singular run id generation** — `/singular` run ids now include milliseconds and random suffix for collision-resistant rapid runs

### Fixed

- **Dependent-task dead-end behavior** — scheduler now marks downstream tasks as blocked when dependencies fail, preventing ambiguous pending states
- **Status update loss under file lock contention** — team task status writes now queue and retry asynchronously instead of being dropped during temporary lock conflicts
- **Steering skip false errors** — parallel task agent no longer marks steering-driven tool skips as execution errors
- **Swarm-from-singular startup guard** — execution now fails fast with a clear warning if no active model is configured
- **Strict delegation in orchestrated contexts** — nested delegation contract now also applies in run/task orchestrated contexts when delegate hints indicate required fan-out

### Documentation

- Updated README to `v0.2.5` and added a focused "What's New in v0.2.5" section
- Expanded orchestration docs (`interactive-mode`, `cli-reference`, `orchestration-and-subagents`) with `/orchestrate` parallel defaults and delegation guidance

## [0.2.4] - 2026-03-12

### Added

- **META profile onboarding UX** — switching to `meta` now shows an explicit runtime hint describing orchestration-first usage and when to switch back to `full`
- **META interruption fallback hint** — when a run ends without any assistant message in `meta`, the UI now emits a recovery warning with concrete prompt guidance
- **Task host-profile runtime getter** — task tool integration now supports dynamic host profile reads (`getHostProfileName`) so orchestration pressure follows live profile changes during a session

### Changed

- **META directive policy (chat-safe classification)** — meta orchestration directive now explicitly classifies non-repository prompts as direct chat responses and limits orchestration rules to actionable repository work
- **META profile system prompt alignment** — profile-level prompt now mirrors the chat-safe classification behavior to avoid conflicting orchestration instructions
- **Internal orchestration metadata aliasing** — hidden orchestration UI metadata now always persists display aliases (including streaming paths) for safer prompt display substitution

### Fixed

- **Profile switch propagation into task orchestration** — runtime profile changes now propagate through session config-change events and task-tool host-profile resolution
- **Invisible assistant responses in meta chat prompts** — assistant prose suppression no longer triggers for `META_ORCHESTRATION_DIRECTIVE` metadata (suppression remains for legacy `ORCHESTRATION_DIRECTIVE` blocks only)
- **Meta interruption messaging consistency** — differentiated interruption guidance now appears for both assistant-level abort/error and run-level early termination scenarios

### Documentation

- Updated README version markers and added a dedicated **Modes At A Glance** block
- Added explicit **META model requirements** guidance (modern models, large context windows, high output limits) in README, CLI reference, interactive mode docs, and configuration docs

## [0.2.3] - 2026-03-11

### Fixed

- **Startup model restore after restart** — `createAgentSession()` now hydrates missing saved provider/model definitions from `models.dev` before resolving default model, so previously selected providers such as coding-plan providers are restored automatically on relaunch
- **Stale startup warning suppression** — interactive startup no longer shows stale `No models available...` warning when model restore succeeds during session initialization
- **Restart UX consistency** — startup header and active session state now align with restored saved `provider/model` selection without requiring manual `/model` re-selection

## [0.2.2] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Models.dev provider+model catalog runtime** — added full catalog parsing (providers + models metadata) with timeout/fallback behavior for interactive auth/model flows
- **Automatic provider model hydration after `/login`** — when a provider has credentials but no built-in model definitions, `iosm-cli` now registers models from `models.dev` so `/model` is immediately usable (including coding-plan providers such as `zai-coding-plan`)
- **Startup/on-demand auth model hydration** — `/model` now attempts to hydrate missing models for saved authenticated providers before rendering provider/model choices

### Changed

- **Provider/model visibility in status line** — footer and model-switch status now display `provider/model` to make cross-provider switches explicit even when model IDs are identical
- **Auth UX feedback** — login flow now reports a clear warning when credentials are stored but no models can be loaded yet

### Fixed

- **API-key login crash** — fixed unbound registry method usage that caused `TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'models')` in interactive login flows
- **Empty model selector after provider login** — fixed cases where `/model` stayed empty after successful API-key auth for providers not shipped in the built-in registry

### Documentation

- Updated README and docs (`getting-started`, `interactive-mode`, `configuration`) to reflect full models.dev-backed provider/model availability via `/login` and `/model`

## [0.2.1] - 2026-03-11

### Added

- **Shared memory tools** — added `shared_memory_write` and `shared_memory_read` tools for subagent orchestration (`run` and `task` scopes, CAS support, append/set modes)
- **Canonical `/swarm` command surface** — added dedicated runtime commands: `/swarm run`, `/swarm from-singular`, `/swarm watch`, `/swarm retry`, `/swarm resume` (with bounded parallelism and budget controls)
- **Swarm scheduler reliability modules** — added dedicated scheduler/locks/gates/state-store/spawn/retry components for stable multi-task dispatch under contention
- **Swarm lock + gate execution model** — introduced hierarchical touch locks and contract-aware task/run gates for `Scopes -> Touches -> Locks -> Gates -> Done`
- **Swarm runtime artifacts** — added persisted run state in `.iosm/orchestrate/<run-id>/` (`run.json`, `dag.json`, `state.json`, `events.jsonl`, checkpoints, reports)
- **Swarm watch telemetry** — added runtime visibility for ready/running/blocked/done distribution, budget usage, lock snapshot, ETA/throughput, critical path, and theoretical speedup
- **Swarm spawn policy controls** — added high-risk spawn candidate classification with confirmation-gated fan-out behavior
- **Project index subsystem** — introduced repository indexing (`.iosm/project-index/index.json`) for scale-aware planning and targeted file selection
- **Failure retrospective engine** — added failure-cause classification and retry directive generation for smarter follow-up attempts

### Changed

- **Swarm-first orchestration flow** — `/singular` execution handoff now supports `Start with Swarm (Recommended)` and routes selected options to `/swarm from-singular ...`
- **Command separation** — `/orchestrate --swarm` removed; `/swarm` is now the canonical gated runtime while `/orchestrate` remains manual legacy team splitting
- **Task orchestration contract** — `task` tool/runtime now carries richer run/task metadata and improved scheduling context for delegated execution
- **Interactive swarm observability** — expanded interactive mode status/watch output with deeper swarm runtime diagnostics and task progress details

### Fixed

- **Swarm retry stability** — improved retry bucket handling (`permission`, `dependency/import`, `test`, `timeout`, `unknown`) to reduce noisy re-runs
- **Lock/contention handling** — improved execution behavior for conflicting touches and blocked tasks in DAG scheduling scenarios

### Documentation

- Expanded README, CLI reference, interactive mode, and orchestration docs for swarm runtime semantics, shared-memory collaboration, and reliability controls

- **Layered contract model** — explicit `project`, `session`, and `effective` contract layers with copy/delete flows and merged runtime enforcement
- **Singular feasibility mode (`/singular`)** — command-first feasibility analysis that combines repository baseline scan with a standard agent pass and returns exactly three implementation options
- **Option-driven execution handoff** — `/singular` now produces concrete file targets, step plans, trade-offs, and decision guidance before implementation starts
- **Regression coverage for large paste UX** — multiline unbracketed paste now covered by dedicated tests to ensure one submission flow and compact marker rendering

### Changed

- **Feasibility workflow naming** — `/blast` replaced by `/singular` for feature feasibility decisions
- **Profile cleanup** — `/shadow` workflow removed to avoid duplication with plan-oriented analysis
- **Contract interaction model** — removed extra save step in field editor; entering value immediately persists to selected scope

### Fixed

- **TUI width safety** — startup resources block now truncates long lines to terminal width, preventing render crashes on narrow terminals
- **Paste queue behavior** — large pasted multiline input is treated as a single paste event instead of fragmented queued submissions

### Documentation

- Expanded README with dedicated decision workflow section (`/contract` vs `/singular`), command migration notes, and clearer contract layer distinctions
- Extended interactive mode docs with explicit `effective/session/project` explanations and migration guidance from removed commands
- Updated CLI reference with interactive feasibility/contract command behavior and migration notes
