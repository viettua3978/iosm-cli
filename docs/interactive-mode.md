# Interactive Mode

Interactive mode is the default experience when running `iosm` without `-p` or `--mode` flags. It provides a rich multi-turn terminal session with persistent history, model switching, and keyboard-driven controls.

## Starting Interactive Mode

```bash
# Default
iosm

# With specific model
iosm --model sonnet:high

# With profile
iosm --profile plan

# Continue previous session
iosm --continue
```

## Core UX

- Multi-turn conversation with persistent session history
- Keyboard-driven controls for model, profile, and queue management
- Live tool execution rendering with expandable output
- Pending message queue for follow-up prompts
- Task plan visualization and progress tracking
- Streaming responses with interrupt/steer capability

`/mcp add` without flags starts a guided wizard in the terminal UI.
`/semantic` opens an interactive setup/status/index/query manager for embeddings search.
Manager includes `Automatic indexing` toggle (default `on`) to control query-time auto-refresh.
`/semantic setup` now auto-loads model catalogs for OpenRouter (`/api/v1/embeddings/models`) and Ollama (`/api/tags`) with manual fallback.
In `/semantic setup`, the headers step is optional: press `Enter` on empty input to skip.
`/memory` opens an interactive manager. `/memory <text>` saves a note to `memory.md` and reloads session context. Use `/memory edit <index> <text>` for direct updates.
`/contract` edits contract fields interactively (`goal`, scope, constraints, quality gates, DoD, risks, etc.), then writes JSON automatically.
`/singular <request>` runs a two-pass feasibility analysis (baseline scan + standard agent pass), builds concrete implementation options, then prompts `Start with Swarm` / `Continue without Swarm` / `Cancel`.
`/ultrathink [-q N|--iterations N] [query]` runs `N` root-agent analysis passes in strict read-only mode (`N` defaults to `5`, max `12`), carries a compact checkpoint between passes, and emits concise per-iteration summaries with a final synthesis.
`/ultrathink` without query reuses the latest meaningful user request from session context.
If early passes produce no tool evidence, ultrathink injects an internal grounding retry so the agent probes the workspace with read-only tools before continuing.
`/swarm` enforces `Scopes -> Touches -> Locks -> Gates -> Done`. If effective contract is missing, it blocks execution and opens a bootstrap menu (auto-draft, guided Q&A, or manual `/contract` editor).
`/orchestrate --parallel` defaults `--max-parallel` to `--agents` when omitted and auto-selects `meta` workers when profiles are not explicitly set (outside read-only host contexts).
For orchestrate assignments, `delegate_parallel_hint` is carried into child task calls; high hints should trigger nested delegate fan-out or explicit `DELEGATION_IMPOSSIBLE`.
If a model emits raw pseudo markup like `<tool_call>`, `<function=...>`, or `<delegate_task>` instead of real tool calls, interactive mode injects bounded protocol-recovery retries.
If a model returns a silent `stop` (no visible text and no tool call), interactive mode injects bounded stall-recovery retries.
`/blast` and `/shadow` are removed from active interactive workflow.

### `/contract` Detailed Guide

`/contract` is a layered contract editor with two sources and one merged output:

| Layer | Scope | Persistence | Storage |
|------|-------|-------------|---------|
| `project` | Project-wide baseline | Persistent | `.iosm/contract.json` |
| `session` | Current session override | Temporary | In-memory session overlay |
| `effective` | `project + session` merged result | Derived | Computed at runtime |

Important merge rule:
- `session` overrides `project` for the same keys.
- `effective` is what the runtime actually uses.

#### Quick Difference: Effective vs Session vs Project

- `Open effective contract` is read-only and shows what runtime is enforcing right now.
- `Edit session contract` changes only this session (temporary overlay, not persisted to disk).
- `Edit project contract` changes `.iosm/contract.json` (persistent baseline for future sessions).

#### Manager Actions

| Action | What it does | When to use |
|------|---------------|-------------|
| `Open effective contract` | Shows the merged JSON currently enforced by runtime | Verify final active constraints |
| `Edit session contract` | Edits temporary overrides for current session | Experiments, one-off constraints |
| `Edit project contract` | Edits persistent project contract file | Team-wide stable defaults |
| `Copy effective -> session` | Saves merged state into session layer | Freeze current merged state for this run |
| `Copy effective -> project` | Saves merged state into project file | Promote temporary decisions to baseline |
| `Delete session contract` | Clears temporary overlay | Reset session overrides |
| `Delete project contract` | Removes `.iosm/contract.json` | Full baseline reset |

#### Field Editor Behavior

- Select a field and press `Enter`.
- Input text (single-line or multi-line list depending on field type).
- Press `Enter` to submit.
- Change is saved immediately to selected scope (`session` or `project`).
- Empty input clears that field.

There is no separate "Save" step in field editor mode.

#### Common Workflows

1. Temporary tightening for one run:
   - Open `/contract`
   - `Edit session contract`
   - Set `constraints` and `quality_gates`
   - Confirm via `Open effective contract`

2. Promote temporary policy to project baseline:
   - Open `/contract`
   - `Copy effective -> project`
   - Review `.iosm/contract.json` in VCS

3. Recover from aggressive temporary overrides:
   - Open `/contract`
   - `Delete session contract`
   - Re-open `effective` and verify fallback to `project`

### `/singular` Detailed Guide

`/singular` is a command-first feasibility mode (no pre-menu).  
Pattern: `/singular <feature request>`

Examples:
- `/singular add account dashboard`
- `/singular introduce RBAC for API`
- `/singular redesign billing reconciliation flow`

#### What Happens Internally

1. Baseline repository pass:
   - Scans project files and estimates baseline complexity/blast radius.
   - Collects likely impacted files and contract signals.

2. Standard agent feasibility pass:
   - Launches an isolated standard agent run (`plan` profile) with repository tools.
   - Agent inspects real files and returns structured feasibility JSON.
   - Produces recommendation, impact analysis, and implementation variants.

3. Merge + persistence:
   - Agent insights are merged with baseline data.
   - Analysis is saved to `.iosm/singular/<run-id>/analysis.json` (+ `meta.json`).

#### Output Shape

Each run includes:
- `recommendation`: `implement_now | implement_incrementally | defer`
- `reason`: why this recommendation is best for current stage
- `complexity` and `blast_radius`
- `stage_fit`: `needed_now | optional_now | later`
- `impact_analysis`: codebase, delivery, risks, operations
- `implementation_options` (exactly 3 variants):
  - Option 1: practical/recommended path
  - Option 2: alternative approach
  - Option 3: defer / do not implement now

Each option includes:
- summary and trade-offs (`pros`/`cons`)
- concrete file targets (`suggested_files`)
- step-by-step plan (`plan`)
- `when_to_choose` guidance

#### Decision Flow

After analysis, selector opens with variants:
- choose Option 1 / Option 2 / Option 3
- or close without decision

If Option 1 or 2 is selected, execution mode prompt opens:
- `Start with Swarm (Recommended)` -> runs `/swarm from-singular <run-id> --option <n>`
- `Continue without Swarm` -> inserts execution draft into editor (ready to run)
- `Cancel` -> exits without changes

If Option 3 is selected, run is explicitly marked as postponed.

#### Fallback Behavior

If no model is selected (or agent pass fails), `/singular` still returns a heuristic baseline analysis.  
Use `/model` to enable full agent feasibility pass.

#### Command Migration

- `/singular` is the feasibility command to use.
- `/blast` is deprecated/removed.
- `/shadow` is removed.

### `/swarm` Detailed Guide

Canonical commands:
- `/swarm run <task> [--max-parallel N] [--budget-usd X]`
- `/swarm from-singular <run-id> --option <1|2|3> [--max-parallel N] [--budget-usd X]`
- `/swarm watch [run-id]`
- `/swarm retry <run-id> <task-id> [--reset-brief]`
- `/swarm resume <run-id>`

Execution note:
- Run-level `--max-parallel` supports `1..20`.
- A single swarm task can use delegated intra-task subagents in parallel (up to 10) when decomposition is beneficial.
- Shared memory tools (`shared_memory_write` / `shared_memory_read`) are available to tasks/delegates that share a `run_id`.
- Standalone `task` calls auto-generate internal `run_id/task_id`, so shared-memory collaboration still works for root + delegates.

Runtime artifacts:
- `.iosm/orchestrate/<run-id>/run.json`
- `.iosm/orchestrate/<run-id>/dag.json`
- `.iosm/orchestrate/<run-id>/state.json`
- `.iosm/orchestrate/<run-id>/events.jsonl`
- `.iosm/orchestrate/<run-id>/checkpoints/latest.json`
- `.iosm/orchestrate/<run-id>/reports/*`

`/swarm watch` includes:
- current state and task breakdown
- budget and warning state
- ETA ticks and throughput
- critical path and theoretical speedup
- lock snapshot and bottleneck tasks

`/orchestrate --swarm` was removed. Use `/swarm ...` directly.

## Profiles

Profiles change the agent's behavior, available tools, and system prompt:

### Main Profiles (switchable via `Shift+Tab`)

| Profile | Tools | Use Case |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `full` | All built-ins (read, bash, edit, write, git_write, fs_ops, test_run, lint_run, typecheck_run, db_run, grep, find, ls, rg, fd, ast_grep, comby, jq, yq, semgrep, sed, semantic_search, fetch, web_search, git_read) | Default development work |
| `plan` | Read-only bundle (read, grep, find, ls, rg, fd, ast_grep, comby, jq, yq, semgrep, sed, semantic_search, fetch, web_search, git_read) | Architecture planning, code review |
| `iosm` | All + IOSM context | IOSM cycle execution with artifact sync |
| `meta` | Full toolset + orchestration-first contract | Adaptive multi-agent/delegate execution with verification closure |

> `meta` profile recommendation: use modern high-capability models with large context windows (`>=128k`, ideally `>=200k`) and high output limits.  
> This directly impacts orchestration quality (delegate fan-out, constraint retention, and final synthesis reliability).

### Advanced Profiles (via `--profile` or orchestration)

| Profile | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| `explore` | Exploratory codebase analysis |
| `iosm_analyst` | Deep metric analysis and reporting |
| `iosm_verifier` | Verify cycle results and quality gates |
| `cycle_planner` | Plan and structure IOSM cycles |

`db_run` is intentionally excluded from read-only profiles and `iosm_verifier`.  
`typecheck_run` is available in write-capable profiles and `iosm_verifier`.

### Example: Planning Workflow

```bash
# Start in plan mode for analysis
iosm --profile plan

# In the session:
# "Analyze the authentication module and propose a migration plan to OAuth 2.0"

# Switch to full mode for implementation (Shift+Tab)
# "Implement phase 1 of the OAuth migration"
```

---

## Streaming Input Modes

While a response is streaming, you can interact with it:

| Mode | Trigger | Behavior |
|------|---------|----------|
| **Steer** | `Ctrl+Enter` | Interrupt and redirect immediately |
| **Follow-up** | `Alt+Enter` | Queue message for after completion |
| **Meta** | Adaptive | Soft update at boundary checkpoints |

### Example: Steering

```
Agent: [streaming a long analysis of the codebase...]

You: (Ctrl+Enter) Focus specifically on the database layer
# Agent immediately redirects to database analysis
```

### Example: Follow-up Queue

```
Agent: [streaming response...]

You: (Alt+Enter) Also check for N+1 query issues
You: (Alt+Enter) And suggest indexing improvements
# Both messages will be processed after the current response
```

---

## Workflow Examples

### Code Review Session

```bash
iosm --profile plan --tools read,grep,find,ls

# "Review src/core/ for code quality issues, focusing on error handling"
# "Check for any security vulnerabilities in the auth module"
# "Generate a summary of findings sorted by severity"
```

### Debugging Session

```bash
iosm --model sonnet:high

# "The checkout API returns 500 errors intermittently. Help me debug."
# Agent will use bash, read, grep to investigate
# "Run the failing test with verbose output"
# "Apply the fix and verify all tests pass"
```

### IOSM Improvement Cycle

```bash
iosm --profile iosm

# "/init" (first time)
# "/cycle-plan reduce API response time"
# "Analyze the current baseline and create hypothesis cards"
# "Execute the Improve phase focusing on query optimization"
# "/cycle-status"
```

### Multi-Agent Orchestration

```bash
iosm

# "Launch 3 parallel agents to:
#  1. Audit auth module security
#  2. Review database query performance  
#  3. Check API contract compliance"

# Or via slash command:
/orchestrate --parallel --agents 3 \
  --profiles explore,explore,iosm_verifier \
  Audit security, performance, and contracts
```
